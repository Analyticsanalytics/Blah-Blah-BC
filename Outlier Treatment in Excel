Q1 = =QUARTILE.EXC(A2:A5156,1), Q3 = =QUARTILE.EXC(A2:A5156,3), IQR = Q3- Q1, Lower Bound = Q1 - 1.5*IQR, Upper Bound = Q3 + 1.5*IQR
95th Percentile = =PERCENTILE.EXC(A2:A5156,0.95)

Now We'll look at the value of 95th percentile and Upper Bound. If both the values are somwewhat nearby, we can replace all the values 
greater than by Upper Bound with the 95th percentile.
If the 95th percentile & upper bound are significantly different and 95th perc is way bigger than upper bound, then we'll look at the
90th percentile and and replace with 90th perce if both are somwehat nearby. and so on.
If Upper Bound is greater than 95th percentile, then we;ll replace it with 98th percentile instead

Also, values which are lesser than lower bound are replaced by 5th percentile.
So basically this is (5th, 95th) percentile capping.

The rule of thumb is, it depends upon the requirements. ALways use logic and see if it makes sense in this situation
